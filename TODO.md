### General

1. 	setTimeout/setInterval
2. 	Push data (Bixby)
3. 	assign route (assign metrics and cache uids)
4. 	Should pagination of metric list be supported? or ability to supply suggestion; e.g., cpu.cp, net.util, mem., etc, just as one does in the search box?
5. 	annotations get route; may need something similar to mQuery, tQuery for annotations. Also support for put, post, delete.
6. 	Instrument logging (e.g., get_response.js ) --> should we instrument logging, or leave this to the client?
7. 	Include browserify instructions; client-side demo.
